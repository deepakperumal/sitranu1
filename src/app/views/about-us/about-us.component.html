                 <h6>
                    It all started on a fine morning at the university dorm. While the
                    rest of the world was celebrating and welcoming the new year 2017
                    cheerfully, we wished to do something remarkable in the new year,
                    we wished to give back to the society, we were brainstorming for
                    ideas. Eventually, we talked about how grateful we are for having
                    the privilege to receive a quality education and how our life
                    would have ended up without having that.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Then, we realized that there exist a plenty of young bright minds
                    who have the potential to radically improve their life, provided
                    they get a quality education. Unfortunately, however, many such
                    young minds are born into the poor families in villages who cannot
                    afford a quality education. We asked ourselves a question: why
                    shouldn't we find such students and sponsor them entirely?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    That question got stuck in our minds. And, our dear reader, as an
                    answer to that question, Sitranu Foundation was born. An open,
                    transparent, community-based foundation where members can donate
                    money, take up volunteering work, bring in potential students,
                    campaign and win the community vote for sponsorship. Basically, a
                    foundation for the community and by the community. Like an Indian
                    traditional baby, the foundation was not born with a name. We
                    called it "Nameless Foundation" initially. In fact, that's how we
                    promoted while adding our initial members. Later, we conducted a
                    name-finding discussion and concluded on "Sitranu Foundation".
                    Sitranu is a beautiful Tamil word, refers to a small atom. An atom
                    that is so small and invisible by itself, but when bonded with
                    several such atoms, it makes a great human being like you and the
                    entire universe that you live in.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Similarly, the helping hands from the members of our foundation,
                    even if it's a fraction of the whole, but when combined with
                    others, makes a great significance. Every member in our foundation
                    is, therefore, a Sitranu who helps in providing quality education
                    for the needy students. Such a meaningful name for what our
                    foundation is all about.

                    In the state of Tamil Nadu in India, every year around a million
                    students appear for the Higher Secondary state examination. There
                    exists a fierce competition among students to land in top
                    universities. There are private schools that are reputed for
                    preparing students to excel in their examinations, but are
                    expensive. On the other hand, a large number of government schools
                    in remote villages have limited infrastructure and a lethargic
                    mindset in pushing students to excel, but it offers free
                    education.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Families living in poverty cannot afford private schooling for
                    their children. Therefore, very talented but poor students from
                    villages lack good teaching and support to attend reputed
                    universities. Our responsibility is to find such potential
                    students and sponsor them for private school education. <br />
                    <br />
                    Our mission is to provide an opportunity and uplift at least 100
                    students every year by 2025 and thereafter.

                       visiting or talking to the students and their parents
                       periodically, mentoring them, getting regular updates on the

                       with greater details on the finances. All the decisions are
                       taken based on member voting. So, you have a say in who gets the
